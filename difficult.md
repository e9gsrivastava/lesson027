# Problem 1 

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which, a² + b² = c². Write a function `special_pythagorean_triplet(n)` that finds the product abc for the Pythagorean triplet where a + b + c = n.

```
def special_pythagorean_triplet(n):

```
# Problem 2
The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

n → n/2 (n is even)
n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain? Write a function longest_collatz_sequence(limit) to find the starting number.

```
def longest_collatz_sequence(limit):

```


# Problem 3
Highly Divisible Triangular Number (Problem 12)
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. Find the first triangle number with over n divisors.

Counting Sundays (Problem 19)
You are given the following information, but you may not use any libraries:

1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
Thirty days have September, April, June, and November.
All the rest have thirty-one, saving February alone, which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
On leap years, twenty-nine.
A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

```
def counting_sundays():
```


# Problem 4

The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Write a function n_queens(n) to find one possible solution.

```
def n_queens(n):
```
# Problem 5

In a M X N grid, find the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally). Write a function largest_product_in_series(series).

```
def largest_product_in_series(series):
```

# Problem 6-- Reciprocal cycles
A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:
```
1/2 = 0.5
1/3 = 0.(3)
1/4 = 0.25
1/5 = 0.2
1/6 = 0.1(6)
1/7 = 0.(142857)
1/8 = 0.125
1/9 = 0.(1)
1/10 = 0.1
```
Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Write a function reciprocal_cycle_length(d) that returns the length of the recurring cycle in the decimal fraction 1/d for a given denominator d.

```
def reciprocal_cycle_length(d):
```
For example, reciprocal_cycle_length(7) should return 6 as the recurring cycle in the decimal fraction 1/7 is 6 digits long.

# Problem 7 
Write a Python function, number_to_words(n), that converts a given integer n (where 0 <= n <= 9999) into words. The function should return the English words representing the given number.

```
def number_to_words(n):
```
For example:
```
number_to_words(123) should return 'one hundred twenty-three'.
```
```
number_to_words(4500) should return 'four thousand five hundred'.
```

# Problem 8 

You are given an array of integers. Your task is to determine whether the array can be almost sorted by performing at most one operation of swapping or reversing. If the array can be almost sorted, print "yes" along with the type of operation. If it is not possible, print "no".

Write a function almost_sorted(arr) that takes an array of integers as input and returns a string indicating whether the array can be almost sorted.

```
def almost_sorted(arr):
```
For example:

```
almost_sorted([1, 5, 3, 4, 2]) should return "yes reverse 2 5".
```
```
almost_sorted([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]) should return "yes swap 3 4".
```


# probelem 9
Write a function infix_to_postfix(infix_expression) that converts an infix arithmetic expression to postfix notation. The infix expression will consist of integers and the operators '+', '-', '*', and '/'. Assume that the input expression is well-formed.

```
def infix_to_postfix(infix_expression):
```
```
infix_to_postfix("3 + 5 * ( 2 - 8 ) / 4") should return
 "3 5 2 8 - * 4 / +".
```

# problem 10


Write a function time_in_words(h, m) that converts the given time represented by hours (h) and minutes (m) into words. The function should return a string representing the time in words.

```
def time_in_words(h, m):
```

For example:

```
time_in_words(5, 0) should return "five o' clock".
```
```
time_in_words(5, 15) should return "quarter past five".
```
